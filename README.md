7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.



8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

Visit the VS Code Marketplace https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/
Browse the categories based on functionalities, languages support or popularity
Read the reviews and ratings  to ensure they are well mainatained and relianble.
You can search by specific keywords.

Click install, once installed most extensions/plugins can be configured or disables within the editor that is when you need and when you dont need them.

Benefits of using extentions:
Increased productivity like linting and formatting can save time and improve code quality.
Provide language support.
Provide version control intergrations.
Tailor your coding environment to your needs and preferences with themes and keybindings.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

VS Code installation:
